How to use Loop?
Loops are useful when you have to execute the same lines of code repeatedly, for a specific number of times or as long as a specific condition is true. Suppose you want to type a ‘Hello’ message 100 times in your webpage. Of course, you will have to copy and paste the same line 100 times. Instead, if you use loops, you can complete this task in just 3 or 4 lines.
